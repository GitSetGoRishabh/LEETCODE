# 📘 LeetCode

This repository contains my solutions to **LeetCode problems**, solved as part of my **DSA and problem-solving practice**.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Practice **data structures & algorithms**
- Improve **problem-solving skills**
- Maintain a **well-organized record** of solved problems
- Track consistency and progress over time

---

## 🧠 Languages Used
- **C++** (primary)

---

## 📂 Repository Structure
Problems are sorted by **question number**.


(Structure may evolve as I solve more problems.)

---

## ✅ What to Expect
